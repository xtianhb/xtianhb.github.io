## Abstract

Electronics engineer turned into a software engineer. At the beginning, started working with embedded software systems and electronics as developer. It continued with python, computer vision, data science, and web solutions. Different roles from developer to tech-lead and architecture in small projects.

Now, looking forward to broadening my experience. Especially interested in data-science, python, C++, back-end, embedded software and other software projects. I am a driven person, ambitious, and enthusiast in computer science and software.
